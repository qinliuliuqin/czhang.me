### About me

I am a Postdoc in the computational Biology program at Fred Hutchinson cancer research center, working with [Erick Matsen](http://matsen.fredhutch.org). Before comming to Fred Hutch, I did my PhD at the Mathematics Department at [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu). My supervisor was [Prof. Hongkai Zhao](https://www.math.uci.edu/~zhao/homepage/home/home.html). My co-supervisor was [Prof. Babak Shahbaba](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~babaks/) from the Statistics Department at UC Irvine. 
I received my Bachelor degree in applied mathematics and Master degree in computational mathematics from Peking University.

<!-- For me, the painful aspects of making a website are

- Working with html and css
- Finding a hosting site
- Transferring stuff to the hosting site -->

### Research interest

My Research area is machine learning and statistics, with interests including graphical models, efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and variational inference methods for Bayesian models, and various applications using probablistic modeling. 

Examples of subjects of interest including:

- Scalable MCMC methods for large-scale Bayesian inference. 
- Graphical modeling of discrete and structured objects.
- Efficient Bayesian Phylogenetic inference algorithms.
